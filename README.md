This project implements a product management system using React.js and the Context API for state management. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products within a web application.

Context API: Utilized for centralized state management across components, ensuring efficient data flow and updates without prop drilling.

Product CRUD Operations: Implemented functionalities to:

Add new products with title, price, description, image, and category.
View a list of existing products with pagination and search functionality.
Edit existing products, updating their details.
Delete products, with confirmation prompts using modal dialogs.
The project utilizes modern frontend development practices, including responsive design using Tailwind CSS and routing with React Router, to deliver a seamless userÂ experience.
